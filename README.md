## Caching

Note that Cloud Terrastodon uses a caching strategy to avoid refetching information, reducing the time it takes for consecutive actions. However, this cache can sometimes get out of date before the automatic expiry window.

You can run

```pwsh
cloud_terrastodon clean
```

to purge the cache.
